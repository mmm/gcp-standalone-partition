# Standalone Compute Nodes in Google Cloud

Templates for building instances and images for a standalone partition of
compute nodes for GCP.

Two things to do in this repo:
- deploy some compute instances to act as a [static compute cluster](example-compute-cluster.md).
- build images for this.

Please note that these are provided only as examples to help guide
infrastructure planning and are not intended for use in production. They are
deliberately simplified for clarity and lack significant details required for
production-worthy infrastructure implementation.
